As India is celebrating the National Mathematics Day today, I bow down to the Thee for bestowing the world with the treasure trove of knowledge. The contributions by Srinivas Ramanujan is inspiring and igniting minds of researchers across the world even after these many years. His works also contributed immensely in erasing the boundaries of science and expanding the thinking capabilities of the scientific community. 

Stay tuned to this space to get many interesting updates of science. Predominantly, in the language of Science. No one can explain the language of science better than Gallileo in his famous quote, "The book of nature is writen in the language of mathematics."
